# Legal Practice Management (LPM) Integrations

## Overview
This document outlines how the Settlement Calculator project can integrate with Legal Practice Management (LPM) software like Litify while remaining fully functional as a standalone application, without requiring multiple codebases.

## Feasibility
Yes, it's absolutely possible to design your settlement calculator project to integrate with Litify (or other practice management software like Needles, SmartAdvocate, or Clio) while remaining fully functional as a standalone application, without maintaining multiple codebases. This is achieved through modular architecture, configuration-driven features, and abstraction layers.

## Key Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep core calculation logic (settlements, reductions, PDFs) independent of external integrations. Use interfaces to abstract data sources.
2. **Configuration Layer**: Enable/disable integrations via environment variables or a settings file, so the app adapts dynamically.
3. **Adapter Pattern**: Create "adapters" for each PMS (e.g., LitifyAdapter, StandaloneAdapter) that implement a common interface for data fetching/sending.
4. **Plugin System**: Allow integrations to be added as optional modules without touching the core codebase.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Define Core Interfaces**:
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for data operations (e.g., `DataProvider` interface with methods like `fetchCaseData(caseId)`, `saveResults(results)`).
   - Core app uses these interfaces, not direct API calls.

2. **Standalone Mode**:
   - Default adapter: `StandaloneDataProvider` that uses your existing MongoDB schema and manual input forms.
   - No external dependencies; app works out-of-the-box.

3. **Integration Adapters**:
   - For Litify: `LitifyDataProvider` that implements the interface using Litify's APIs (e.g., OAuth auth, GraphQL/REST queries).
   - For other PMS: Create similar adapters (e.g., `ClioDataProvider`) with their specific APIs.
   - Each adapter handles authentication, data mapping, and error handling.

4. **Configuration & Switching**:
   - Add environment variables (e.g., `PMS_PROVIDER=litify` or `PMS_PROVIDER=standalone`).
   - On startup, load the appropriate adapter via dependency injection (in NestJS).
   - Frontend: Conditionally show integration-specific UI (e.g., "Sync with Litify" button only if enabled).

5. **Shared Components**:
   - Core calculation engine, PDF generation, and UI components remain unchanged.
   - Integrations only affect data import/export and optional features (e.g., auto-sync).

## Example Code Structure
```
backend/src/
├── core/                    # Core logic (calculations, PDFs)
├── adapters/                # Integration adapters
│   ├── standalone.adapter.ts # Default (MongoDB)
│   ├── litify.adapter.ts     # Litify API
│   └── clio.adapter.ts       # Clio API (future)
├── config/                  # Configuration loading
└── main.ts                  # Load adapter based on env
```

## Benefits
- **Single Codebase**: One repo, deployable in any mode.
- **Scalability**: Add new PMS integrations by creating new adapters.
- **Maintenance**: Core features evolve independently of integrations.
- **User Flexibility**: Clients choose their PMS; app adapts.

## Considerations
- **Testing**: Test each adapter separately and in combination.
- **Security**: Secure API keys and handle data permissions per PMS.
- **Costs**: Some PMS APIs have usage fees; monitor accordingly.
- **Data Mapping**: Ensure consistent field mappings across systems.
- **Documentation**: Clearly document setup for each integration mode.

This approach follows software engineering best practices (e.g., SOLID principles) and is common in SaaS applications. If you provide more details about specific PMS features, I can help outline adapter implementations!
